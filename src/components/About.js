                <p>
                    I am dedicated to building more secure and equitable digital systems, bridging the gap between academic research and real-world industrial applications. As a PhD candidate in Blockchain technology, my work is centered on data marketplaces for the energy sector and the long-term sustainability of DAOs.

                    Currently researching at the University of Turin and LINKS Foundation, I explore how blockchain technology can enhance privacy, 
                    trust, and interoperability in data exchange systems. I'm particularly interested in advanced cryptographic protocols like 
                    Zero-Knowledge proofs and Multi-Party Computation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Beyond research, I bring hands-on experience in full-stack development and have contributed to European collaborative projects 
                    including EU-DREAM, DataCellar, and eFORT. I'm passionate about community building and serve as organiser for TEDxSchio 
                    and former Chapter Director for Startup Grind Padova.

                    When I'm not immersed in research, you might find me playing Ukulele, practising mixed martial arts, or exploring a new corner of the world. I'm always open to discussing new ideas and collaborations; feel free to explore my projects.
