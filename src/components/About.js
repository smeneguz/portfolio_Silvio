                    I'm a PhD Candidate in the National Program in Blockchain and DLT located at University of Turin, researching how blockchain technology can actually solve real-world problems. My focus is on data marketplaces and smart societies; areas where transparency and trust matter but are often lacking.

                    Right now I'm deep into DAO sustainability research and working on European projects that combine digital twins with blockchain. I love Zero-Knowledge proofs and cryptographic protocols, but what really drives me is seeing whether these tools actually work when people use them.

                    I've been coding since I was a teenager; started with simple websites and now build everything from smart contracts to React apps. These days I work between LINKS Foundation in Turin and various university collaborations across Europe. I also organise TEDx events and used to run the Startup Grind community in Padova.

                    When I'm not buried in code or research papers, you'll find me training martial arts, attempting to play ukulele, or exploring new places. I'm always keen for conversations about technology, research directions, or honestly just about anything that sparks curiosity.
